    A prompt is the text description you provide as input to DALL-E 3. The model uses this description to generate images.

### Crafting Effective Prompts

1. **Be Clear and Specific:** The more specific your prompt, the better the output. For example, instead of saying “Draw a tree,” say “Draw a large oak tree with green leaves and a swing hanging from one of its branches.”
2. **Include Details:** Add as many details as possible, such as colors, environments, styles, and actions. For example, “A futuristic cityscape at night with flying cars and glowing buildings.”
3. **Experiment with Styles:** You can specify artistic styles, mediums, or influences. For example, “A watercolor painting of a serene beach during sunset.”

### Examples of Effective Prompts

- “A photorealistic image of a cat sitting on a windowsill with rain outside.”
- “An abstract painting of the concept of time.”
- “A retro-style poster featuring a robot playing a guitar.”
- “A children's book illustration of a friendly dragon flying over a village.”

## Useful Features
